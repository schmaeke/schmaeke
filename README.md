## 🧑🏻‍🔧 About Me

I’m a **mechanical engineer** by training with strong interest for numerical methods used to **solve partial differential equations**.


### 🌱 My work primarily revolves around:

- **High-order methods** for increased accuracy and computational efficiency.
- **Immersed boundary techniques** that handle complex geometries seamlessly.
- **Adaptive mesh refinements** that don't destroy/modify the initial mesh and are free from common constraints.


### 💡 My other technical interests are:

- **Typesetting with LaTeX**: Whether it is writing documents or creating graphics, I use LaTeX. I often share my templates and document classes on my GitHub.
- **Open Source Software**: While my time doesn't allow me to contribute much I'm always exploring and utilizing new projects from the FOSS community.
